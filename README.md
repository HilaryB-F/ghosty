_Flappy Bird, but spooky_

I am highly intereseted in creating games, but during my schooling we didn't touch on the subject, so to start my journey in the gaming world I decided to make a rip off of Flappy Bird. I followed a tutorial on how to make it but I came up against some challenges that my tutorial didn't address. 

The tutorial didn't have any styling, as the creator wanted it to be super simple, but I love my styling and I always go above and beyond. Importing images that kept to their correct proportions, but also grew and shrank was the hardest thing to overcome. But in the end I got it to work! 

This is still a work in progress as I would like this to become my first react native project, so stay tuned for that! ðŸ‘» ðŸŽ‰
